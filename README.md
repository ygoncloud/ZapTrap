# ZapTrap
# DAST Vulnerable Application Example

This project provides a simple, intentionally vulnerable Node.js web application for
the purpose of demonstrating Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) with OWASP ZAP.

The application contains a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

## Project Structure

- `app.js`: A minimal Express.js web server with a vulnerable search endpoint.
- `package.json`: Defines the project's Node.js dependencies.
- `Dockerfile`: Instructions to build a Docker image for the web application.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Orchestrates the startup of both the web application (`webapp`) and the OWASP ZAP scanner (`zap`).
- `zap-report/`: This directory is created to store the HTML report generated by the
ZAP scan.

## How to Run the DAST Scan

This setup uses Docker and Docker Compose to automate the entire process.

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Steps

1.  **Build and Run the Scan:**
    Navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
    This command will:
    - Build the `webapp` Docker image.
    - Start the `webapp` container.
    - Start the `zap` container, which runs a full active scan against the webapp.
    - The `zap` container will exit automatically when the scan is complete.

2.  **View the Report:**
    Once the scan is finished, a report will be generated at:
    `zap-report/report.html`

    Open this file in a web browser to see the vulnerabilities ZAP discovered. You should find a "Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected)" alert.

3.  **Clean Up:**
    To stop and remove the containers, run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

## Manually Testing the Vulnerability

To see the XSS vulnerability in action, ensure the `webapp` is running and navigate to the following URL in your browser:

```
http://localhost:3000/?search=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

You should see a JavaScript alert pop up, confirming the vulnerability.
